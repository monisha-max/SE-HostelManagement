##  Why We Built This (The Fun, Honest Truth)
-  Lost & Found Chaos
Lose something in the hostel? You either make 10 calls, send 20 WhatsApp photos, or it‚Äôs gone forever. We fixed that. Snap it, upload it, and everyone can see and claim it instantly.

-  Washing Machine Guesswork
Ever paced to the laundry room every 10 minutes just to find someone else‚Äôs clothes inside? Or worse‚Äîleft your own and had them mysteriously disappear? Now you just book a slot and relax. No more laundry roulette.

-  Complaints in the Void
You write your issue in a dusty complaint notebook and‚Ä¶ it vanishes into the abyss. Our platform logs every complaint, tracks its status, and ensures it's seen and solved.

-  Room Cleaning Confusion
Want your room cleaned? Too bad‚Äîthere‚Äôs no system, and you‚Äôll never know when it's your turn. We added a slot-based room cleaning scheduler. Book, confirm, and breathe easy.

-  Roommate Roulette
Getting a roommate whose vibe doesn‚Äôt match yours? Say hello to sleepless nights and awkward conversations. We introduced a Score-Based Roommate Matching System‚Äîso you‚Äôre more likely to be paired with someone who actually respects your sleep schedule.

-  Sick Day Struggles
You‚Äôre unwell. But you still need to walk to the mess, stand in line, and carry your food back. Why?! With HMS, you just submit a Food Request, and your needs are logged and managed. Rest like you deserve to.

-  Never-Ending Questions
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the laundry policy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the warden?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the WiFi password?‚Äù Enter the AI-powered Hostel Chatbot‚Äîavailable 24/7, powered by real-time web scraping and intelligent search. Ask away, and skip the endless group chats.

From broken processes to brilliance‚Äîwe turned problems into features. HMS isn't just software. It's a student-life upgrade.

- Because we believe managing hostel life shouldn‚Äôt feel harder than clearing your midterms.
